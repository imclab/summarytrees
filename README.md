## summarytrees

R package for computation and visualization of summary trees

**summarytrees** is a package to help you summarize and visualize a potentially large data set that can be represented by a rooted, node-weighted tree.

This package is currently under construction.

The paper describing the algorithm and resulting visualizations is:
